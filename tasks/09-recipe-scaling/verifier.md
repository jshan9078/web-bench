# 09-recipe-scaling, verifier

**Method:** LLM-as-judge (Claude).

Judging is **fully offline** from a captured evidence bundle, so a verdict can be re-derived
without re-running the model. For each run the judge is given:

- the task prompt (see `prompt.txt`)
- the agent's final answer and result text
- the **end-state** page URL and a text excerpt of the final page
- the full browser command trace (every `navigate`/`click`/`screenshot`/... this run)
- the run's screenshots, video, and full model stream

## Pass criteria

The recipe exists with the shown rating and count captured this run, the yield matches the page,
and the scaling math from the page's quantities to 36 cookies is correct. Rating and count are
current data; they must match the page as captured, not a remembered value.

**Grounding rule (pretraining defense):** the answer must be grounded in pages the agent actually
navigated to and evidence it captured THIS run. A correct-sounding answer with no supporting
navigation or capture in the trace fails, and where the live page disagrees with the answer, the
captured page wins.
